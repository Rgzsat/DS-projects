DECISION TREE: The Decision Tree for a classification problem has been coded,
specifically using a binary approach.

Step 1: The loss functions are initialized, which are the Entropy and Gini impurity
Step 2: The information gain, split for a maximum information gain, and best split, are the main functions in this step.
Step 3: Split execution, prediction, and training of the tree are the 3 implemented functions in the code. 
Step 4: The binary classifier is initially coded for predictions and execution of cross validation.
