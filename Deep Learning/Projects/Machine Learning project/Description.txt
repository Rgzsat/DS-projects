This final project focuses on implementing Machine Learning algorithms 
for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) according 
to Health and Charge indicators based on End-of-Life (EOL) criteria.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
are the Supervised algorithms executed for diagnostics.
