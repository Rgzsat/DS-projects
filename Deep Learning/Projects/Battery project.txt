For this project, a range of deep learning algorithms have been implemented to 
perform time series forecasting, predictive analytics, and regression on battery systems. 
The following neural network architectures were chosen:

1) Convolutional Neural Network
2) Artificial Neural Networks
3) Recurrent Neural Networks
4) Transformer Networks
