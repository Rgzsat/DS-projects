For this project, a range of deep learning algorithms have been implemented to 
perform time series forecasting, predictive analytics, and regression on battery systems. 
The data is proprietary and confidential, corresponding to hundreds of tests for the whole 
Machine Learning cycle: Training, Validation, and Testing
The following neural network architectures were chosen:

1) Convolutional Neural Network
2) Artificial Neural Networks
3) Recurrent Neural Networks
4) Transformer Networks
