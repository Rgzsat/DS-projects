1) Neural Networks
The solution consists on implementing several functions to compute the calculations and execute 
the algorithm based on 2 hidden neural networks

2) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
A dataset containing training and validation folders, which can be downloaded 
from the reference in the Jupyter Notebook, considering a binary classification of bees or ants.

3) Vision Transformer
This problem consisting of a Vision Transformer and a beans dataset.
Three categories of beans are the basis of the classification problem.
