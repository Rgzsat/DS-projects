Description:

You are provided with a P10, P50, and P90 day-ahead power forecasts together with an
actual power of a PV farm in Estonia. Your task is to determine and propose an optimal
day-ahead sales strategy, i.e. the optimal P-level forecast to use, which would yield us
the highest total revenue.

Consider that there are just 2 streams of revenues, day-ahead (DA) revenue and
imbalance revenues, which are calcualted for each MTU (15 min period). Total revenue
is a sum of those 2 revenue streams across all MTUs. Also, consider that you can always
limit production of solar PV assets (i.e. produce less), but cannot increase the
production. E.g. if you sell 4 MWh in DA market and would actually produce 6 MWh, you
can limit the production to 4 MWh in that specific MTU.
