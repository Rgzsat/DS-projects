This final project focuses on implementing Machine Learning algorithms 
for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) according 
to Health and Charge indicators based on End-of-Life (EOL) criteria.

Density-based spatial clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Ordering
Points to identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 
are the Unsupervised techniques implemented for anomaly detection.
