This final project focuses on implementing Machine Learning algorithms 
for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) according 
to Health and Charge indicators based on End-of-Life (EOL) criteria.

Density-based spatial clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Ordering
Points to identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 
are the Unsupervised techniques implemented for anomaly detection, while Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
are the Supervised algorithms executed for diagnostics.
